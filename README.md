## mac-to-win-ahk
Basic [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script for people who use Windows but prefer macOS hotkeys, such as if you use Mac at home and Windows at an office.

As a bonus, there's a [registry key remapping](print-screen-to-rwin.reg) from Print Screen to RWin that addresses a minor inconvenience with specific placement of Print Screen on some keyboards. Note that if you had previously remapped keys via the registry, importing the registry file above may override them.
